\subsection{leg\_detector} %detection

The leg detector uses a machine-learning classifier to read the scans for possible legs, while inputting sensor\_msgs/LaserScans, to receive these readings. This node then publishes people\_msgs/PositionMeasurementArray for the single leg, however it will also check for co-occurrence, which mean that it will try to pair the single legs detected by the scan as an estimate of where a person's center might be positioned \cite{legdetect}. This can be used with face recognition to further improve the readings of the scans to find the center of individuals. To pair these two, the seeded version of leg\_detector is needed because it will use another source of position measurement beside from the sensor data and guide the algorithm to locations of possible people. This mode is enabled by the parameter :use\_seeds.
