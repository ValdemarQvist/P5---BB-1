\section{RealSense D435}

As the LIDAR the RealSense camera from Intel is also an active sensor. The RealSense camera is an Red, Green, Blue, Depth(RGB-D) camera, this means that the RealSense camera have a coloured image camera and it can calculate depth. The depth is not acquired from the colored camera but the two Infra-Red(IR) cameras, that is used in a stereo vision manner, and a laser that is projecting an IR pattern.\cite{RealSense}\\
The RealSense also have tracking capabilities, based on the input from the IR camera, this is useful for gathering data on the movement of shoppers.\cite{RealSense}\\
Some of the reason why this RealSense was chosen over other
well know RGB-D cameras as the Microsoft Kinect, which was used in the Spencer robot, or the ASUS Xtion, is the depth viewing capabilities and the field of view (FOV) of the RealSense. It has a depth viewing distance from 0.1 m up to 10 m depending on the environments illumination\cite{RealSense}, wheres as the Kinect has from 1.2 meters and the Xtion camera has from 0.3 and both up to 3.5 meters\cite{Xtion}\cite{Kinect} depending on the illumination. The FOV horizontal for the RealSense is 87\degree and 58\degree vertical where as Xtion has 58\degree horizontal, 45\degree vertical\cite{Xtion} and Kinect 57\degree horizontal, 43\degree vertical\cite{Kinect}. Moreover the RealSense camera can capture more frames per second than the other two aforementioned cameras, which will provide more depth information, and it can be used in outdoor and indoor illuminated scenes.\cite{RealSense} \\
