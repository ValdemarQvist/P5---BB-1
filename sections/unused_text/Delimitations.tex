%A proof-of-concept version of the described robot has been developed. Due to time constraints and limited access to equipment, delimitations has been made from the requirements.
%The main focus of the project is to get a prototype of a sensor suite working for tracking people, having a good and easy interface will not be focused on.
%Additionally, due to the complexity of comprehending human social norms and detecting human emotions the robot will not have the ability to adhere to every social norm expected by humans. 
%Since the focus of the project is to get a working prototype and the implementation and analysis of the system in an actual warehouse is not feasible, performing a complete economical analysis of the implemented system is outside the scope of the project.
