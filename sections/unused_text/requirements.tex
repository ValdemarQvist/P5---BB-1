%KRISTIAN START
%For the robot to be a good solution, it must satisfy a list of criteria that is essential to ensure a good experience for all users, both customer and owner of the facilities. This includes:\\

%Must create a positive HRI user experience.\\
   % - Must have a good and easy interface.\\
    %    - Must be usable within 1 minute.\\
        
    %- Must respect human social norms.\\
       % - Must keep a distance to respect personal space.\\
       % - Must make eye contact to show attention, but must take breaks to not   stress the user.\\
        
    %- Must not cause physical harm.\\
       % - Must avoid collisions.\\
       % - Must operate at safe speeds.\\
    
%Must be time efficient for customers compared to the traditional shopping method.

%Must be cost-efficient for the owners of the companies who facilitate shopping with the robot.
%KRISTIAN SLUT

%\subsubsection{Requirement 1 - Moving to goal location}\label{req1}
%Each robot should move from its starting location to the end location without collisions.

%\subsubsection{Requirement 2 - Correct location}\label{req2}
%Each robot should move to the correct goal location.

%\subsubsection{Requirement 3 - Communication between multiple robots}\label{req3}
%All robots in the same hypermarket needs to be able to communicate, knowing the locations of each other.

%\subsubsection{Requirement 4 - Choosing the route}\label{req4}
%Each robot needs to choose the fastest route that does not cause collision when planning the route.

%\subsubsection{Requirement 5 - Distance to customers}\label{req5}
%Each robot has to avoid customers with a comfortable distance for bystanders when moving.

%\subsubsection{Requirement 6 - Comfortable interaction}\label{req6}
%The interaction between each robot and the customers should be comfortable.

%\subsubsection{Requirement 7 - Comply with standards}\label{req7}
%Each robot has to comply with the standards for mobile assistance robots.

%\subsubsection{Requirement 8 - Navigating}\label{req8}
%Each robot has to navigate a highly dynamic area while be able to guide the user and locate the goods.

%\subsubsection{Requirement 9 - Distinguish between customers}\label{req9}
%Each robot needs to distinguish between who is following customer currently using it and everyone else.


%A proof-of-concept version of the robot described has been developed. Due to lack of knowledge and equipment, delimitation has been made from the requirements. 
%A static distance has been implemented to determine the distance to customers is will pass by, moving from one position to another.
%The delimited requirements can be seen below:

%\subsubsection{Delimitation 1 - Communication between multiple robots}\label{del1}
%Since only one robot will be made as a proof-of-concept, it will not be able to see the locations of other identical robots.

%\subsubsection{Delimitation 2 - Distance to customers}\label{del2}
%It has been decided that the comfortable distance to customers is x cm.

%\subsubsection{Delimitation 3 - Comply with standards}\label{del3}
%The standards will not be tested since we do not have the knowledge on how to test or implement the standards. An emergency stop button will be implemented to be able to shut down the robot immediately if needed.

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item \textbf{1:} The robot must be able to give a positive HRI user experience.
   
%    \item \textbf{1.1:}  The robot must uphold the personal space required for the user and the other shoppers
   
  %  \item \textbf{1.2:}  The robot must keep eye contact to show interest, but stopping at the required time, so the shopper wont be stressed.
   
  %  \item \textbf{1.3:}  The robot must have a user-friendly interface, which should have a latency maximum of 1 minute.
    
  %  \item \textbf{1.4:}  The robot must be able to communicate with the hypermarket to find the respectable wares.
    
 %   \item \textbf{1.5:} The robot must chose the fastest route available.
    
   % \item \textbf{2:}  The robot must comply with the standards for a mobile robot.
    
  %  \item \textbf{3:}  The robot must not cause physical harm.
    
  %  \item \textbf{3.1:} The robot must avoid collisions.
    
   % \item \textbf{3.2:} The robot must travel with a speed limit that are safe for it surroundings.
    
   % \item \textbf{4:}  The robot must be cost-efficient for the owners of the companies who facilitate shopping with the robot.

%As with all projects, endless resources are never realistic and this project is no different. With a time span of 4 months and limited manpower, the full project can not be realised within the frames.
