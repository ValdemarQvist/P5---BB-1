\textit{"Hypothesis 1. Following the compensation model, derived from
nonverbal research, participants will maintain a greater distance
with the robot when the robot maintains eye contact with them
than they do when it avoids gaze."}\\

\textit{"Hypothesis 2. Following the attraction-transformation model,
which has been proposed as a bridge to explain verbal and
nonverbal cues, how much participants like the robot will affect
their distancing behaviour with the robot; they will maintain a
greater distance with the disliked robot when the robot maintains
eye contact with them than they do when it avoids gaze, while
maintaining a smaller distance with the liked robot when the robot
maintains eye contact with them than they do when it avoids gaze."}\\
