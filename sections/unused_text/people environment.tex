\section{People's environment (Working title)}
When humans interact they adhere to social norm regarding how to act when speaking with certain people. This means that a certain distance is kept when talking to a friend and keeping another distance when talking to someone new. This concept is know as personal space.\cite{PeronalSpace}\\
\hspace*{7mm} When working with mobile robots the personal space applies as well. This means that mobile robots must keep a certain distance to people in order for them to feel comfortable around the robot. Additionally, the robot must also keep a distance to ensure the physical safety of the people around it. When it comes to the physical safety of people around mobile robots, the collision avoidance system of such a robot usually regards humans as an obstacle and therefore, acts accordingly to prevent any collisions. However, the distance of physical safety and the distance of human comfort are not necessarily equal, and therefore a robot intended to move around humans must move with a certain distance for humans to feel comfortable moving around these robots.\\
